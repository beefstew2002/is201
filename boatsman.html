        Fare, please.
        </p><br><p>
        It’s not polite to stare, boy. Why don’t you look at the trees along the riverbank. See how they reflect in the still waters? See how the sunlight glimmers on the ripples in the distance? See how the clouds paint the sky such beautiful shades of gold and pink as the sun goes down? 
        </p><br><p>
        Years. This ferry is the envy of every workman in the village. Every day I get to watch the light change as the sun moves across the sky, filtering through the trees, scattering off the river. Enjoying the breeze, the flowers. My favorite part is the silence.
        </p><br><p>
        I said years, boy. You should know better than to ask an elder their age.
        </p><br><p>
        The warriors of the North? Of course I’ve heard. But you should be careful who you listen to, boy. Gossip and rumors spread like fire in dry grass. If you really believe half of what you hear, you’re traveling the wrong direction. South is that way.
        </p><br><p>
        Another glory-chaser. You certainly are arrogant for such a young man. What advantage do you think you have over the rest of the doomed fools?
        </p><br><p>
        You believe I am a swordsman, and want me to teach you the blade?
        </p><br><p>
        You are misinformed. I am but a humble boatsman.
        </p><br><p>
        Him? He died fifteen years ago in the last war. You’re on a fool’s errand, boy. You should turn around. I’ll even reimburse your fare.
        </p><br><p>
        …Is that name supposed to mean something? If this “Djungleskog” is foolish enough to look for me, the least he could do is come himself instead of sending some poor errand boy on a wild goose chase.
        </p><br><p>
        Who told you these stories? Remember what I said about rumors like fires, boy. The more they spread, the bigger they grow. I hardly fought off three Northern assassins, I simply escaped a few thugs. Thugs stupid enough to deliver a message <i>before</i> putting a knife in my back. That’s what pride does to you. Much better to be a simple, humble boatsman. 
        </p><br><p>
        Look at me, boy. I may have my share of scars, but I’m no cripple. I’m in fine shape for my age. A man like me with the right training could make a fortune as a mercenary. If you’re so sure I’m such a mighty swordsman, maybe you should ask yourself why someone who walked the path you seek would instead choose a simple life on the river. 
        </p><br><p>
        Rumors. Even if the Northern tribes really were preparing to march, they will not be victorious. The next Chosen One will stop them as they always do. There’s no need for you to run off and die at their hands. Even if you survive, glory is not the prize you think it is. Every man you kill is somebody’s son, somebody’s father, somebody’s husband. Do you want their anguished spirits to haunt your dreams? Do you want their children to hunt you for vengeance?
        </p><br><p>
        Have you ever been a lover, boy? Have you ever looked into someone’s eyes and truly seen them, and finally felt seen by someone else? Have you ever exalted in the freedom of knowing someone else understands who you are? Imagine if someone looked into your eyes and recoiled with horror. They saw the blood you had spilled, the bodies you had left heaped upon the earth. You cannot share that battle with them. You must bear it alone.
        </p><br><p>
        Think on that image, boy. Leave the war to the Chosen One and the fools who go seeking their own glory. Why don’t I turn us around, you enjoy a warm drink and a rest in the inn, and tomorrow you go back home?
        </p><br><p>
        Of course the Chosen One always wins. The scholars have observed the cycle for centuries. Just before the Northern tribes come down to conquer, some youth is Chosen and guaranteed victory over them. They train, they fight, they usually die in the process, but as long as they show up, they always defeat the Warlord and push the Northerners back. Their success is fated. They don’t need armies; the only people who follow them into battle are fools hoping to be one of the lucky few to return alive and be showered with fame. The Northerners are fierce and fame is fleeting. It’s better to stay home. 
        </p><br><p>
        You still want to go north? Do you even know how to use that blade you carry?
        </p><br><p>
        <i>You’re</i> the Chosen One?
        </p><br><p>
        So you <i>have</i> been listening. Well, you’re right. You don’t need anyone special. Any old swordsman from here to the Cliffs could teach you what little you need to know to win. If you’ve already made it this far, I’ll rest easy knowing the Northerners will never make it as far as this river. 
        </p><br><p>
        …
        </p><br><p>
        Have you ever fought a Northerner, boy?
        </p><br><p>
        Their warriors are fierce. Their Warlords grow stronger with every generation. They’re desperate to break the cycle, to finally defeat a Chosen One. The last Warlord once killed ten men with a single swipe of his sword. When the Chosen One fought him, he barely managed to nick his arm before the Warlord’s blow splattered him across his honor guard. The Warlord died weeks later from an infection. 
        </p><br><p>
        Are you afraid, boy? 
        </p><br><p>
        Good. Courage is not the absence of fear, it is the strength to endure it.
        </p><br><p>
        Show me that blade you carry.
        </p><br><p>
        What? Not like <i>that.</i> Did Djungleskog teach you <i>anything?</i> You have to pull the scabbard forward as you slide the blade out. Try again.
        </p><br><p>
        Careful getting the tip in the scabbard. Don’t cut yourself. Now bring the sword out.
        </p><br><p>
        Slower.
        </p><br><p>
        Better. Again.
        </p><br><p>
        Again.
        </p><br><p>
        Again.
        </p><br><p>
        You’ve got a lot to learn if you want to have a prayer to survive. Practice that move one thousand times. Then come meet me at the dock tomorrow and show me what you’ve learned.
        </p><br><p>
        …well, of course he would say that.
        </p><br><p>
        Of course not. I’m just a humble boatsman.
