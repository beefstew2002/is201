        Red light bled through the dark clouds like a flashlight shining through fingers. Its deep hue denied illumination to any other colors, casting the entire world in shades of red and black. Occasional dark drops sprinkled down from the clouds, disturbing the red reflections in the layers of gunk that had built up on the asphalt. Signs that were once colorful were reduced to shades of red and crusted over with black trails of dried fluids. Every breath of air had the smell of rotting fish and a metallic tang sharp enough to taste.  
        </p><p>
        Drew and Susie picked their way down the road, enduring the stench. Their short-sleeved summer clothes offered little relief from the smothering heat.
        </p><p>
        Drew carried a package of disposable water bottles under each arm. His arms were burning from the effort. He wasn’t used to this kind of exertion. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and a drop rolled into his eye. He blinked it out. He tried to breathe through his mouth to escape the smell. His backpack was stuffed with washcloths, rags, and wipes. One water bottle holder held a thermos half-full of water. The other held a bottle of hydrogen peroxide he’d found, which might help with the dark crusted stains on his shirt. Every passing raindrop that hit him left another one. Hopefully one of the others had found some ponchos or garbage bags somewhere. No room for laundry detergent this time, but what they already had at home should last for a while. They needed all the water they could get for drinking and cooking, but they saved two buckets of “clean” water to wash their clothes in. One of the buckets had once been for rinsing, but now the water was too soapy to make a difference. The filmy, grainy slipperiness of the unrinsed soap on Drew’s shirt chafed against the layers of grime building up on him after two weeks since his last bucket shower. He kept a safe distance from Susie, hoping she couldn’t somehow smell him through the rancid haze. 
        </p><p>
        Susie’s face was twisted by a scowl that matched the baseball bat she wielded in her left hand. Nails had been pounded into the top, and bits of dark gunk stuck to them. In her right hand, she clutched a fistful of plastic grocery bags laden with the widest variety of canned beans she could find. Not that the variety made a difference; they’d all look like varying shades of red and their flavor would be overwhelmed by the inescapable stench of decay. She’d also grabbed a few spray cans of dry shampoo and a hairbrush. One of the heavy-duty ones with metal bristles going all the way around. Like a miniature version of her bat. Someone had stolen her last one. Her long blonde hair, now shrouded under the same red hue as the rest of the world, was matted, tangled, and splitting. When she ran her fingers through it, they picked up layers of oil, snagged on dark bits sticking like wads of gum, and tugged loose strands free. Dry shampoo and vigorous brushing would help, a little. 
        </p><p>
        The pair walked in mutually courteous silence. Maybe if Drew could clean himself up, he’d risk bothering Susie with a question or two. She was the only one in the group close to his age.  But he was so dirty he almost wanted to apologize for walking with her. If she was trying to ignore the horror around them, the last thing he wanted to do was disturb her like a talking piece of the nightmare. If he couldn't separate himself from the mess, at least he could be ignored with it. For now, he’d do her a favor and keep to himself. Susie wasn’t thinking about Drew, or how he smelled, or what color the sky was, or whether her family was alive. That was all buried under the greasy mass of disintegrating fibers stuck to her head and hanging over her face. She just wanted to get back home and brush and scrape and drag the clinging, suffocating nastiness out of her hair. 
        </p><p>
        They avoided the deeper puddles but occasionally cut through shallower ones. Their exposed socks or ankles were speckled with dark dried splash marks. Their shoes soaked up liquid and squelched as they walked. There was a wet ripping sound every time they peeled a foot free to take a step. Drew felt a raindrop and watched the bead of dark liquid roll off his arm. They weren’t far from home. They’d be safely indoors before the rain really picked up again.
        </p><p>
        A layer tore loose under Drew’s foot and slid out from under him. Susie turned and saw him slip but was too far away to reach him. Drew barely managed to steady himself before he could fall or drop his water bottles in the muck. He breathed a sigh of relief. Susie, still scowling, nodded at the averted mess and turned to continue walking. Drew heard a footstep behind him. Susie took another sticky step forward before she heard it and stopped again. Without the sound of their own footsteps, they could hear a third set. They glanced back. A bloated silhouette was lurching towards them. In the red light, it was hard to tell if the dark tatters clinging to its body were scraps of clothes or torn skin and muscle. Its breaths were heavy and ragged. It dragged its feet through the road’s grime as it walked, laboriously limping in their direction. 
        </p><p>
        Drew’s heart pounded, but he reminded himself they weren’t in any immediate danger. There was only one. Those creatures were persistent, but slow, weak, and stupid. If the road weren’t so slick and their bags weren’t so heavy, they could run, and it wouldn’t be able to keep up. Even if it dashed for them here, they could dodge away or push it over, although a scratch or a bite might become a problem later. Who knew where those mouths had been, or what was under those fingernails? In a real emergency, one good whack with the bat would put it down for good. For now, they just kept walking, occasionally glancing back to keep an eye on it. It kept stumbling after them but didn’t get any closer.
        </p><p>
        Drew noticed an abandoned car in the road ahead of them. Under the red light, its true color was darkened to black. Raindrops on its surface reflected red like a thousand shining eyes. Drew quickened his pace towards it, stepping carefully to avoid slipping. He could rest there, but he wanted to put some more distance between himself and the creature behind him. 
        </p><p>
        Susie understood his intention and slowly crossed to the other side of the street, luring the creature away from him. Whatever intelligence might be left inside of it was too hungry to strategize. Even with the grocery bags, Susie could stay ahead of it easily, and she had the bat. She was just lending Drew some more time to rest.
        </p><p>
        Drew stepped gingerly through the deep puddle around the car, trying not to splash his socks. He set the water bottle boxes on the hood, careful to make sure they didn’t slip on its wet surface. His shoulders sagged with relief as he released the boxes. He swung his arms around, trying to flush the burning out of them while he could. Susie was across the street, safely leading the creature away.
        </p><p>
        Something sticky grabbed Drew’s ankle and yanked. Drew slipped and splashed into the puddle. His hands scraped on the asphalt at the bottom of the muck. His foot was pulled under the car. He kicked blindly with his other foot. Something screeched.
        </p><p>
        The first creature turned away from Susie and dashed towards Drew, swinging its arms wildly as it ran. Susie dropped her bags of cans and ran after it. 
        </p><p>
        The puddle soaked into Drew’s clothes and stuck them to his skin. The fluid was thicker than water. He braced his foot on the car and pushed himself away. A skeletal arm kept a firm grasp on his leg as he pulled it out from under the car. He kicked at it. 
        </p><p>
        The first one was almost on top of him before Susie knocked it away with the bat. It fell with a shriek and splashed in the puddle, spraying both of them with more drops of scum. Drew yanked his leg free from the other one's arm and scrambled backwards, scooting through the muck. The first creature grabbed his shoulder. Susie smacked it away with the bat again. It hissed and tried to stand up. Susie yelled and smashed the bat into its skull. 
        </p><p>
        The whole thing exploded. 
        </p><p>
        Dark gunk sprayed in all directions. The sound had the piercing bang of a popped birthday balloon and the lingering splatter of a watermelon dropped from a third-story window. The omnipresent rusty stench was joined by the flavors of vomit and sewage. Drew felt a fleck or two hit his forehead, but he was mostly shielded from the blast by Susie. 
        </p><p>
        Susie still held the bat out in front of her. Chunks of the creature’s legs lay in the muck at her feet. The other creature under the car was still wheezing, but it didn’t crawl out. A few more dark bits rained back down.
        </p><p>
        Susie turned around with a few squelching footsteps. She was plastered head to toe in putrid black chunks and grimy fluid, sticking to her like mud. Drops of something dark rolled down her face and arms, leaving trails. Her hair was splattered with slimy chunks. 
        </p><p>
        Susie suppressed a gag and spat something salty out of her mouth. Warm fluids trickled down her face and ran into her eyes. She wiped scum out of her eyes and scowled. She raked her hair and caught a few sticky bits on her fingers, but most of them would cake into place soon. Drew was still sitting in the puddle, staring at her. She rested the baseball bat on her shoulder and extended a hand to help him up.
        </p><p>
        Drew pulled his hands out of the muck and tried to dry them on his shirt before accepting Susie’s hand. She pulled him to his feet. His clothes were cold and clung to him. Absorbed fluid weighed down his backpack and dribbled back into the puddle.
        </p><p>
        The second creature was still clawing out from under the car, wailing and gurgling. Drew backed away from it. Susie went around to the front of the car and reached for the water bottles with the bat. She snagged the nails on the shrinkwrap of the first box and yanked it off the car. 
        </p><p>
        Drew waded through the puddles back to where Susie had dropped her bags. Some of the cans had spilled out and rolled on the ground. Drew wiped them off on his wet shirt and put them back in their bags. Susie’s new hairbrush lay in a puddle. Drew snatched it up. Half of the brush was painted black by the filth. If it dried, it would be impossible to get the bristles clean again. Drew pulled his thermos out of his backpack and opened it. He took one last sip of cool water before carefully pouring the rest over the brush, rinsing off most of the filth. The water fell to the road, splashing his socks, and ran out. A few dark scabs still clung to the brush, but it was mostly clean again. 
        </p><p>
        Drew carried the bags back to the car. Susie felt a raindrop as she watched him. She’d pulled the water bottle boxes off of the hood and stacked them. Drew set the bags down carefully to make sure nothing fell out. He set his backpack on the stacked boxes and rummaged through it. The washcloths at the bottom were soaked. He pulled out a package of wipes and offered it to Susie. She snatched it, tore it open, and pulled out a wipe. In the light, even the white wipe looked totally red. She scrubbed some of the black gunk off her face and grabbed another wipe. Drew took one for himself and they both wiped their hands clean. Susie felt another raindrop. She looked up. The red sky was darkening. A gentle pitter-patter whispered that they didn’t have time to clean themselves up.
        </p><p>
        Susie handed the wipes back to Drew and grabbed her bags. Drew put the wipes away, pulled his backpack back on, and scooped up the water bottle boxes. No longer concerned about slipping, they ran as fast as their cargoes allowed, their shoes squelching with every step.
